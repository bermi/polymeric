noConflict for polymer element collections

This project is an experiment where I will attempt to wrap a collection of polymer elements into a namespace.

Goals:

- Create 3rd party polymer components that can co-exist on a page that uses a different version of polymer.
- Wrap polymer and all it's dependencies on a private JS closure to prevent polluting window.
